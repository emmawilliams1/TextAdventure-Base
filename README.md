TextAdventure-Base
==================

An example that offers ideas on how to get started with a JavaScript-based HTML5 text adventure game.
The title of my game will be "Jungle Escape: Can you get out alive?"
The game will open in a clearing in a jungle, the user will look around and be surrounded by trees, hear rustling to the left, and be given the option of yelling out, walking straight, left, or right, or investigating the rustling noise.
The setting is the jungle, the user will see many trees and have the opportunity to interact with streams (to get water), trees and vines (climing, swinging) and branches to use as weapons.
Gorillas are one enemy in the forest, but if the user goes about it right they can be friendly and will take the user into their tribe. A panther will attack, but if the user is holding onto the branch they should have picked up at some point they will beat the panther. These are both opportunites to lose lives. Additionally, dying of thirst or starvation is possible, so they will interact with streams and berries to sustain their person. 
The pick-up action is available to berries, water, branches, and baby gorillas (this action will result in immediate death)
Users can walk, run, kneel, climb, and swing
The game ends in two ways - one, if the user dies 3 times, or if the user manages to escape the jungle and make it to the ship waiting to bring them back over the ocean.
